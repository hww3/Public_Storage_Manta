This is a module providing support for the Joyent Manta object storage and compute fabric. 
Included are a client capable of communicating with a Manta storage fabric, as well as a 
Filesystem module.

```
#!pike


object c = Public.Storage.Manta.client_from_keys("https://us-east.manta.joyent.com", 
                                                 "myUser", "/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa" [, keypass]);

array entries = c->list_directory("~~/stor");


```
